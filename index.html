        IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: In the past year or 2, Bunkercoin has been having issues with the blockchain.
        Often, there would be only one active miner and when they stopped, the chain got stuck since it had been more than 24 hours since a new block.
        <br>
        Here is an overview of the announcements I have made in the Bunkercoin Discord server:
        <ul>
            <li><b>17 april 2025</b> Hi @everyone, I'm considering shutting down my node on May 10th if no new blocks have been mined by then.
                By that date, it will have been 3 months since the last block was mined. Since the chain wasn't really used for anything other
                than mining even before it got stuck, I don't really see the point in keeping it running. If you have any reasons for why I
                shouldn't shut it down, please let me know via DM. If I shut the node down, please be aware that I'll shut the explorer
                (https://explorer.bunkercoin.org/) and it's .onion equivalent down along with it, since the explorer requires a node to get the
                block information.</li>
            <li><b>28 may 2025</b> Does anyone have a working (linux) version of sgminer(-gm) or bfgminer? I'm trying to mine on my (AMD) GPU,
                but I can't get any version/fork of sgminer to compile (linking or compile errors), and bfgminer gives an error when I run it
                (I think it doesn't like the bunkercoin block things)</li>
            <li><b>8 june 2025</b> Okay update. Here's a list of miners I've tried on windows: sgminer-gm, sgminer (nicehash version), nsgminer,
                cgminer (version 3.7.2, so before gpu support got removed), ccminer (tpruvot version), ccminer (tecracoin version), ccminer
                (klausT version). And on linux: bfgminer, nsgminer, sgminer (by sgminer-dev), sgminer (by nicehash), sgminer-gm, YACMiner. And
                pool software I've tried: stratum-mining (doesn't install, relies on a python2 package), node-stratum-pool (rejected shares or
                hardware errors). None of these work, so the only option seems to be to mine straight to the wallet with cpuminer-opt, which
                would take over 200 days on my CPU.</li>
            <li><b>4 july 2025</b> @everyone Unfortunately, @The Linux Expert/Idiot  attempt to mine a block with his USB ASIC didn't work out.
                Renting a mining rig isn't feasible either since I can't get any pool software to work. Sadly, this means that there are no more
                things that I can think of to try in order to revive Bunkercoin. In response, I have shut down my node (and its onion equivalent)
                and the Bunkercoin Explorer (and its onion equivalent) as they are no longer useful. The Bunkercoin Faucet, Bunkertip and any other
                services related to Bunkercoin that I used to host will not be turning back online either unless someone manages to revive the
                blockchain. The Bunkercoin website (https://bunkercoin.org/) is still online as it is hosted by Github Pages, not me. If you know
                of any other Bunkercoin services that are still online, please let me know as I will add them to the list. If anyone wants to host
                any of the services that I used to host, please contact me as I will try to help you set it up. Similarly, if you want to try to
                revive to revive Bunkercoin yourself, please contact me if you need any help! I still want to preserve this awesome community, so
                please don't take this as a sign to leave the server. I will add a notice to the Bunkercoin website explaining the decision I've
                made. I will also create an archive with the source code of all the Bunkercoin programs combined, along with the contents of this
                Discord server in order to preserve the Bunkercoin legacy. Despite this sad announcement, I want to thank everyone that was part
                of the Bunkercoin journey. for the time and effort they have provided. Together, you guys have made Bunkercoin one of the most
                memorable projects of my life.</li>
